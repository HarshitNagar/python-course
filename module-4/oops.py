# What is OOP ?
# - OOP: Object Oriented Programming
# - It is a programming paradigm in which the code is structured by packing related properties and behaviours into objects.
# - For eg: Lets say you want to track employees in an organisation.
# - Properties: Name, age, gender, ID, address, contact etc.
# - Behaviours: What would you want to do with an employee ?
# - Assign department
# - get details of the employee
# - calculate employee salary
# - Using lists ?
# - ```
aman = ['aman', 30, 'M', 123]
neha = ['neha', 34, 'F', 134]
employees = [aman, neha]
# ```
# - Using dict ?
# - ```
aman = { 'name': 'aman', 'age': 30, 'gender': 'M', 'id': '123']
neha = { 'name': 'neha', 'age': 34, 'gender': 'F', 'id': '134']
employees = [aman, neha]
# ```

# # __str__ and __repr__ methods
# - The methods that begin and end with double underscores are called dunder methods or magic methods
# - They are a fundamental part of python's internal class mechanism. Python calls them automatically in response to specific operations
# - eg: __init__ is the most commonly known dunder method. This method is an instance initializer. This gets called automatically when a class constructor is called.
# - __str__ provides informal string representations of for objects.
#   - This method must return a string that represents the object in a user-friendly manner.
#   - You can access an objectâ€™s informal string representation using either str() or print().
# - __repr__ provides formal string representations of for objects.
#   - it must return a string that allows you to re-create the object if possible.
#   - This string representation is mostly targeted at Python programmers

# # Inheritance
# - It is the process by which once class takes on the attributes and methods of another class.
# - The class that inherits the attributes and methods is called the child class/derived class/sub class.
# - The class whose attributes and methods are inherited is called parent class/base class/super class.
# - Child class can overwrite or extend attributes and methods of parent class.

# # single inheritance
